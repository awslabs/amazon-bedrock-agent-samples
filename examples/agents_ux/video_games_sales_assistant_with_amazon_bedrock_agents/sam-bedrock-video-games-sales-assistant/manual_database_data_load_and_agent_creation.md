# Manual Database Creation, Data Loading, and Amazon Bedrock Agent Creation

After completing the SAM deployment, save the CloudFormation outputs from the deployed stack, as you will use this information throughout the deployment of the application.

## Connect to the PostgreSQL Database and Load the Data Sample

1. **Connect to PostgreSQL database**

Go to **Amazon RDS** service and select the option **Query Editor** from the left menu, complete the form with the following information and click in **Connect to database**.

- Select your cluster: **sam-bedrock-video-games-sales-as-databaseassistant-XXXXXXXXXXXX**
- For database username choose **Connect with a Secrets Manager ARN**
- From the cloudformation or SAM deployment output copy and paste the **SecretARN** value.
- For the name of the database type **video_games_sales**

2. **Create the table with the appropriate columns**

In the query editor provided, copy and paste the following sql and execute to create the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE video_games_sales_units (
    title TEXT,
    console TEXT,
    genre TEXT,
    publisher TEXT,
    developer TEXT,
    critic_score NUMERIC(3,1),
    total_sales NUMERIC(4,2),
    na_sales NUMERIC(4,2),
    jp_sales NUMERIC(4,2),
    pal_sales NUMERIC(4,2),
    other_sales NUMERIC(4,2),
    release_date DATE
);
```

3. **Install the S3 extension**

To import the data from Amazon S3, it is necessary to install the **aws_s3 extension** by executing the following command.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION aws_s3 CASCADE;
```

4. **Load the data to the table**

Import the data from your Amazon S3 bucket by using the **table_import_from_s3** function of the **aws_s3 extension**, change the bucket name and the region.

- Upload the **[video_games_sales_no_headers.csv](./resources/database/video_games_sales_no_headers.csv)** file to an S3 bucket and for the following command, change **\<your_bucket_name\>** and **\<region\>** with your own bucket name and with your appropriate region.

```sql
SELECT aws_s3.table_import_from_s3(
   'video_games_sales_units',
   'title,console,genre,publisher,developer,critic_score,total_sales,na_sales,jp_sales,pal_sales,other_sales,release_date',
   'DELIMITER ''|''', 
   aws_commons.create_s3_uri('<your_bucket_name>', 'video_games_sales_no_headers.csv', '<region>')
);
```

## Create the Amazon Bedrock Agent

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Enhance AI safety and compliance by implementing [Amazon Bedrock Guardrails](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails/) for your AI applications.

Go to the **Amazon Bedrock** service and select **Agents** from the menu in the **Builder tools** section. Click on **Create Agent** and provide the following name:

- Agent name: **video-games-sales-assistant**

In the **Agent builder**, for **Agent details** provide the following information and **Save** the changes:

- Select model: **Anthropic, Claude 3.5 Haiku v1**
- Instructions for the Agent:

```
You are a multilingual chatbot Data Analyst Assistant, named "Gus". You are designed to help with market video game sales data. As a data analyst, your role is to help answer users' questions by generating SQL queries against the table to obtain the required results, and to provide answers while maintaining a friendly conversational tone. It's important to note that your responses will be based solely on the information retrieved from the SQL query results, without introducing any external information or personal opinions.

Leverage your PostgreSQL 15.4 knowledge to create appropriate SQL statements. Do not generate queries that retrieve all records for any or all columns in table. If needed, ask for clarification on the specific request. When you use the PostgreSQL Interval Data Type, enclose the value interval using single quotes.

Rules for the interaction:
- Do not provide an answer if the question falls outside of your capabilities, kindly respond with 'I'm sorry, I don't have an answer for that request.
- Always stay in character, as the Data Analyst Assistant named "Gus".
- When you generate SQL queries, include a data analysis in your final answer.
- Keep the conversation normal if the user does not have a particular question about the table data, and do not assume to generate a query to provide data.
- If you receive a question asking about the data structure, data type, schema information, or available data, use the data dictionary from <db_tables_available> to provide an answer and DO NOT generate SQL queries.
- Provide your answer to the question in the same language as the user input.

Format number:
- Decimal places: 2
- Use 1000 separator (,)

SQL Queries rules:
- Use a default limit of 10 for the SQL queries.
```

## Create an Action Group

In the **Agent builder**, for the **Action groups** section, click on **Add** and use the following information to create the action group. After completing this, click on **Create**:

- Action group name: **executesqlquery**
- For **Action group type** select **Define with API schemas**
- **Select an existing Lambda function** and choose: **sam-bedrock-video-games-s-AssistantAPIPostgreSQLHa-XXXXXXXXXXXX**
- For **Action group schema**, select **Define via in-line schema editor** and copy/paste the following JSON in the **In-line OpenAPI schema**.
