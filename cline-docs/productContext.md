# Product Context

## Purpose
This repository demonstrates the implementation and usage of Amazon Bedrock multi-agent collaboration features, with a focus on creating practical examples that showcase how multiple AI agents can work together to solve complex tasks.

## Problems Solved
1. Demonstrates how to implement multi-agent systems using Amazon Bedrock
2. Shows how to orchestrate complex workflows across multiple specialized agents
3. Provides examples of different collaboration patterns:
   - Supervisor mode for complex task orchestration
   - Supervisor with routing for unified customer experiences
4. Illustrates integration with AWS services and external APIs
5. Shows how to handle state management and agent communication

## How It Works
The system operates through several key components:

1. Multi-Agent Architecture
   - Supervisor agents that orchestrate complex workflows
   - Specialized collaborator agents that handle specific tasks
   - Built-in routing capabilities for intent-based task distribution

2. Shared Code Assets
   - Working Memory for state management
   - Web Search capabilities for information gathering
   - Stock Data lookup for financial information
   - Utility functions for agent creation and management

3. Development Patterns
   - Direct boto3 API usage
   - Helper classes for simplified agent creation
   - YAML-based configuration for agents and tasks
   - Standardized approaches for agent collaboration

The system is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing developers to create their own multi-agent solutions while following established patterns and best practices.
