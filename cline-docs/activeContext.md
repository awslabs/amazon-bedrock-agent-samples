# Active Context

## Current Focus
Working on multi-agent collaboration examples and understanding shared code assets in the src folder.

## Recent Changes
1. Moved demo UI to agents_ux folder:
   - Relocated UI components to examples/agents_ux/
   - Updated systemPatterns.md with new folder structure
   - Maintained existing UI split across config.py, demo_ui.py, and ui_utils.py

2. Created Memory Bank documentation:
   - productContext.md: Project purpose and architecture
   - systemPatterns.md: Technical patterns and decisions
   - techContext.md: Development setup and constraints
   - progress.md: Current state of implementation
   - activeContext.md: This file for tracking current work

## Current State
1. Repository Structure
   - Multi-agent collaboration examples in place
   - Demo UI components organized in agents_ux folder
   - Shared code assets available in src folder
   - Core utilities for agent management

2. Documentation Status
   - Memory Bank initialized
   - Core documentation in place
   - Example-specific documentation available

3. Development Environment
   - Python environment configured
   - AWS credentials set up
   - Required dependencies installed

4. Demo UI Refactoring and Improvements
   - Split monolithic demo-ui.py into three files:
     * config.py: Bot configurations and constants
     * agent_utils.py: Agent interaction and trace processing
     * demo_ui.py: Main UI and session management
   
   - Added missing trace functionalities from mac-demo.py:
     * Code interpreter trace handling (input/output)
     * Knowledge base lookup output display
     * Action group invocation output handling
     * Token usage tracking and LLM call statistics
     * Final response handling in expandable sections

   - Documentation improvements:
     * Added screenshot to README.md showing UI features
     * Updated architecture section with clearer feature descriptions
     * Improved documentation of trace visualization capabilities

## Next Steps
1. Test all bot configurations with new trace functionality
2. Gather user feedback on UI improvements
3. Consider additional trace visualizations or statistics
4. Monitor token usage patterns across different agents
